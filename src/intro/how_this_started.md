# How this started

It was originally started by the 2022 Rapid React scouting lead, Joseph Melancon from a fork of team 2471's scouting app. As the year went on, a freshman rookie by the name Aiden Lee(the one writing this) wrote an API backend in python for Meanscout to easily convert the data into a readable format in a csv file. We would then use that csv and import it into Google Sheets.
