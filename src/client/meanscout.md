# Meanscout Client
This chapter will go into how to use Meanscout, typically located at [https://scouting.team4198.org/](https://scouting.team4198.org).

First navigate to the menu button on the top left, in this menu you must change 3 values, these values should not reset unless you tell them to. I recommend double-checking these values every shift change:
1. Location - set this to the location assigned to you this location does change throughout the day so watch out and make sure you're set to the right location on every shift change.

2. Event passcode - this is a unique password we will tell you at the event it should be noted that the passcode changes with every event.

3. Name - literally just a field for your name.
