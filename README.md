# Meanscout Book
Documentation behind our own meanscout, and the api. Build with MdBook

## What is this?
In depth documentation behind [Meanscout](https://github.com/4198-Programmers/Meanscout_4198) and the [API](https://github.com/4198-Programmers/meanscout-api)

## How can I contribute?
First you need to make sure you have the [rust](https://rust-lang.org) package manager, cargo installed. It comes with the installation of rust. Once that is done, you must get mdBook via `cargo install mdbook`.
